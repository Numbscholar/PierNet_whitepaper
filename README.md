# PierNet: Decentralized Community-Driven Internet Access

## What is PierNet?
PierNet is a **decentralized mesh network** that allows users to share bandwidth **peer-to-peer** instead of relying solely on traditional ISPs. Using **token incentives**, PierNet ensures **sustainable, community-driven connectivity** that can operate **with or without ISPs**.

## How It Works
- **Piers:** Nodes that relay data and expand network coverage.
- **Harbors:** Gateways that provide optional internet access.
- **Token System:** Participants earn tokens for sharing bandwidth and spend tokens for access.
- **Hybrid Governance:** A **DAO model** ensures both token holders and active users help shape the network.

## Why PierNet?

ISP Dependence** â€“ Users can create local networks that function independently when needed.


Just a VPN or TOR Alternative** â€“ Unlike TOR, AREDN, or VPNs, PierNet enables **real bandwidth sharing** and decentralized expansion.


Participation** â€“ Instead of relying on goodwill, PierNet aligns economic incentives to keep the network running.


in Cities & Rural Areas** â€“ Whether offloading ISP traffic in urban centers or sharing Starlink in remote areas, PierNet adapts.

## How is PierNet Different?

| Feature            | **PierNet** | **TOR** | **AREDN** | **VPNs** |
|--------------------|------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| **Purpose**       | Decentralized Internet Access & Bandwidth Sharing | Anonymity & Censorship Evasion | Emergency Mesh Networking for Hams | Secure Private Traffic Tunneling |
| **Works Without ISP?** | **Yes, for local communication**; requires Harbors for internet | No, needs ISP access | Yes, for local mesh | No, needs ISP |
| **Economic Model?** | **Tokenized incentives for bandwidth sharing** | None | Volunteer-based | Subscription-based |
| **Who Can Use It?** | **Anyone with compatible hardware** | Anyone | Licensed ham radio operators | Anyone |
| **Best For?**      | **Offloading ISP traffic, creating alternative networks, incentivized bandwidth expansion** | Staying anonymous online | Emergency communication | Secure private access |

## Get Involved
PierNet is in **early-stage development**, and we need **collaborators** to help refine its architecture, test implementations, and develop user-friendly solutions.
