PierNet: Decentralized Community-Driven Internet Access

What is PierNet?

PierNet is a decentralized mesh network that allows users to share bandwidth peer-to-peer instead of relying solely on traditional ISPs. Using token incentives, PierNet ensures sustainable, community-driven connectivity that can operate with or without ISPs.

How It Works

Piers: Nodes that relay data and expand network coverage.

Harbors: Gateways that provide optional internet access.

Token System: Participants earn tokens for sharing bandwidth and spend tokens for access.

Hybrid Governance: A DAO model ensures both token holders and active users help shape the network.


Why PierNet?

 ISP Dependence** â€“ Users can create local networks that function independently when needed.

 Just a VPN or TOR Alternative** â€“ Unlike TOR, AREDN, or VPNs, PierNet enables real bandwidth sharing and decentralized expansion.

 Participation** â€“ Instead of relying on goodwill, PierNet aligns economic incentives to keep the network running.

 in Cities & Rural Areas** â€“ Whether offloading ISP traffic in urban centers or sharing Starlink in remote areas, PierNet adapts.
